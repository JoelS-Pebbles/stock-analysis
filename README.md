# VBA Challenge

## Overview of project
We need to refactor the macro just in case Steve wants to have more than just 12 stocks. Refactoring the code is making it more efficient and potentially faster. This can include skipping certain steps from before, and combining other steps as well. I refactored the code to where it runs faster and more efficiently. 

##Results
For the code that is not refactored, the timer says it takes around .8 seconds for the macro to run for years 2017 and 2018. The refactored code is around four times faster, taking only .2 seconds to run the refactored macro. Below are two pictures. The first one is the output and the timer that says how long it took to run the regular code. The second picture shows how long it took to run the refactored code.
